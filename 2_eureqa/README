# Use Eureqa to develop a model predicting Tm of i-motifs
################################################################################
Formula building blocks:
BE - Basic (constant, input variable, ±, x, ÷) and Exponential (power, sqrt)
BTE - BE and Trigonometry (sine, cosine)

Error metric: Absolute error (default)

Data splitting: Treat all data points equally (default)
- How it's done: (1) shuffle all rows first then split into training and data,
as to how they split:
Based here: http://formulize.nutonian.com/forum/discussion/632/data-splitting/p1
"If there are less than 50 rows, the entire data set is used for training and 
validation. If there are less than 150 rows the entire data set is used for 
training. We would prefer not to share the details of how the fractions are 
calculated other than to say it is dependent on the number of input rows. 
You can specify exactly how many rows to use for training and for validation 
using the custom data split setting which hopefully should be sufficient for any 
of your needs."

Runs:
Features are C, T1, T2, T3, length. Scaled run means predictors (not the outcome)
were subtracted by the mean and divided by the standard deviation using the 
eureqa built-in function.

a. Tm - BE (unscaled), BE (centered and scaled), BTE (unscaled)


Result:
a. Tm
The observed vs. predicted plot is based on one model from the iMotif_chosen_BE.fxp 
(unscaled features) and then applied on i-motif data split into training (80%) 
and (20%) exactly the same way as in xgbTree. The metric is calculated on test 
data only as in xgbTree. 

With features unscaled, length only appeared in the 2nd least accurate model  
(Tm=42.3 + length). After centering and scaling, it did appear but only in more 
complex models, complexity>27 (sample model has complexity=14).

b. pHt
Note that eureqa thinks that pHt has a large offset and has to be normalised

"stability" refers to how long the solution list hasn't changed
"maturity" relates to how much computational effort has been put into the 
current listed solutions.
